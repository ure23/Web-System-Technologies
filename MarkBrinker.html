                <p>Let's start by defining the various parts of a website:</p>

                <article>
                    <h3>Header</h3>
                    <p>The header is the top section of a website</p>
                    <p>Years ago, headers often featured big banners</p>

                <article>
                    <h3>Pre-Header</h3>
                    <p>The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header.</p>
                    <img src="" alt="">

                <article>

                    <p>A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)</h3>
                    <p>The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website</p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>On mobile devices, navigation links often transform into an icon</p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>For more complex websites with tons of pages</p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>
                    <p>Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location</p>
                    <p>Home > Blog > Latest Posts > Post Title</p>
                    <p>Breadcrumbs make it easy for visitors to understand where they are on your site</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Website Content</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to written text, you'll often hear it called web copy or body copy</p>
                    <p>Website content is everything on your site that communicates your message to visitors.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Homepage (or home page)</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="">homepage</a> — also called the front page or main page</p>
                    <p>The homepage sets the tone for the entire website.</p>
                    
                    <div>
                        <p>Common elements on a home page include:</p>

                        <li>A navigation menu to help visitors find key pages</li>

                    </div>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Homepage Hero Area (aka Feature Area aka Headline Area)</h3>
                    <p>The Homepage Hero Area is the top section of a homepage that grabs your attention.</p>
                    <p> It often spans the full width of the page and typically includes key elements like:</p>
                    <li>A headline that clearly communicates the site's purpose or the problem it solves.</li>
                    <li>A sub-headline that adds supporting details or context.</li>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>The term “hero” comes from traditional print media.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Slider</h3>

                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>Most often find sliders on homepages, either as a replacement for a hero image.</p>
                    <p>While sliders used to be a common design trend, their popularity has decreased in recent years.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Website Content</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to written text, it's often hear as a web copy or body copy, but website content goes beyond just words. </p>
                    <p>Website content is everything on your site that communicates your message to visitors.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Alt Text</h3>
                    <p>Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is a brief description added to images on a website.</p>
                    <p>It serves two main purposes:</p>
                        <ol>It makes websites more accessible by describing images to visually impaired users who rely on screen readers.</ol>
                        <ol>It helps search engines understand what an image is about.</ol>
                    <p>For example, if you have an image of an office space, instead of leaving it without a description.</p>
                </article>

                    <h3>Sidebar</h3>

                    <img src="" alt="">
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Sub-Footer</h3>
                    <p>The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a webpage.</p>
                    <p>While its content varies by site, a sub-footer typically includes elements such as:</p>
                    <li>Quick Contact Information: Displaying addresses or phone numbers for immediate reference.</li>
                    <li>Supplementary Navigation Links: Offering shortcuts to key pages like “About Us.”</li>
                    <p>The sub-footer is designed to serve as an added layer of user convenience</p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Footer (The "True" Footer)</h3>
                    <p>The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a webpage.</p>
                    <p>Common footer contents include:</p>
                    <li>Copyright and Legal Disclaimers: Noting trademark rights and the copyright year.</li>
                    <li>Policy Links: Links to the privacy policy, terms of use, and any other legal information.</li>
                    <p>This section is static across the entire site and represents the definitive end point </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>Note: Although many people refer to both areas (i.e. sub-footer and footer) as the “footer,” they're actually two different things. </p>

                    <li>Blog posts are organized chronologically.</li>
                    <li>Web pages (like the homepage, about page, or contact page) are static.</li>
                    <p>Blogs also tend to have a more casual, conversational tone compared to standard web pages.</p>

                    <p>Card design organizes content into visually distinct “cards” or tiles, often arranged in a grid layout.</p>

                <p>I hope you found this mini crash course on website terminology helpful.</p>

                <p>I'll be updating this glossary over time, so if there's a term I missed.</p>
