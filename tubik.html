            <p>“The details are not the details. They make the design,” Charles Eames once said, and that has never stopped to be true.</p>

            <h3>Header</h3>
            <p>Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage.</p>
            <p>Headers may include a bunch of meaningful layout elements, for example:</p>
            <li>call-to-action button</li>
            <li>links to basic categories of website content</li>
            <li>links to the social networks</li>
            <li>basic contact information (telephone number, e-mail address, etc.)</li>
            <p>It doesn't mean that all the mentioned elements should be included in one web page header.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            
            <article>
                <p>Shipping company website uses the header zone effectively: it includes a company logo in the left corner.</p>
            </article>

            <p>What makes a header a vital element contributing to web usability is the fact that it is placed in the most scannable zone of a web page. </p>
            <p>Some of the popular design practices for web headers include:</p>
            <li>hamburger menu: hiding the set of links to different pages or section</li>
            <li>sticky header: header that doesn't hide away but sticks to the top part of the page when users are scrolling the page down. </li>
            <li>two-layer navigation: a sort of double set of navigation sites in the header to separate two different routes.</li>
            <p>One more widely-used pattern for website headers is making a logo clickable.</p>

            <h3>CTA Button</h3>
            <p>Is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a user to take a certain action. </p>
            <p>Effective call-to-action buttons are easy to notice; designers intentionally create them so that website visitors could see them in split seconds and respond.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <article>
                <p>About page for <a href="">ShipDaddy website</a> is a good example of the call-to-action element instantly noticeable in the general webpage layout.</p>

            <h3>Footer</h3>
            <p>Footer is the lower (bottom) part of the web page which usually marks its end.</p>
            <p>Footers can include:</p>
            <li>credits to website creators</li>
            <li>contact forms and information</li>
            <li>links to company or product accounts in social networks</li>
            <li>testimonials and badges</li>

            <h3>Slider</h3>

            <li>user engagement</li>
            <li>attractive visual hook</li>

            <h3>Search</h3>
            <p>Internal search is a functionality that enables a visitor to browse the content inside the website.</p>
            <p>If your website is made of 50+ pages, it's high time you considered applying the internal search.</p>
            <p>Another vital point to mention is that designers shouldn't prioritize search over navigation in a user interface. </p>

                <p>Sidebar menu: quite a classic type</p>
                <p>Megamenu: that's the complex expandable menu</p>

            <li>increased findability: breadcrumbs give users another touchpoint to the content.</li>
            <li>effective use of screen space: crafted well, breadcrumbs take a narrow horizontal line.</li>
            <li>no misinterpretation: breadcrumbs are hardly ever misunderstood by users.</li>
