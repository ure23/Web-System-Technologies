            <h2>Why do you need to think about page structure</h2>
            <p>Let's start by defining what a webpage is, as it is not the same as a website.</p>

            <h3>1. Header</h3>
            <p>First up is the header or a site menu. Sitting right at the top, it is the primary thing</p>

        <article>
            <h3>4. Footer</h3>
            <p>Scrolling down to the bottom of the page, you'll find the footer. Of course, it might</p>
            <p>This section often contains important links, contact information, social media</p>

            <h3>18. White space</h3>
            <p>Time to talk about white space, often the invisible element of great web design.</p>
            <p>It doesn't necessarily have to be white, by the way. It's all about the unmarked</p>
